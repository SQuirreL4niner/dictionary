This project is a dictionary application that extends oxford-dictionary-api. It uses React.js
for UI, Bootstrap 4, Material UI, and plain css for styling, and a Node.js server with Express.js routes to proxy to Oxfords API to avoid any Cors issues. It also uses local storage to save search history. Also, the create-react-app CLI was used to scaffold the application
